        <h3>About</h3>
        <p>Kobe Bean Bryant (23 Aug 1978 - 26 Jan 2020) was an NBA player who player for the Los Angeles Lakers for 20 years (1996-2016). He came into the league as a mere 18-year-old directly from high-school. He was determined from day one with a simple goal of being the greatest basketballer of all-time. He worked day-and-night, every day, for years and years to achieve his goal. As a teenager living in the spotlight, he lived a life for the whole world to see. He worked his tail off, didn’t take any shortcuts, obsessed about winning and gave attention to every small detail to perfect his game; he became the toughest player to guard and possibly the greatest ever. As his career was unfolding, he learned to lead, and learned to dominate without his athletic ability. He touched so many lives with his passion.
Kobe included moves of many former greats into his arsenal. He popularized the Mamba Mentality which meant to work on your craft every day, polish your craft so that no edge is left unsharpened, and believe in your training. He learned how to learn things from basketball and then used it in his future projects; he won an Oscar for the Best Animated Short-film – Dear basketball.
He was a man of sheer will, unflinching focus, and a personality so charming that he appeared superhuman. A true testament to what can be achieved with strong will. Today we celebrate a man who has become an example on how a person should lead their life. It aches to know that we can’t experience things that he’d more to offer to this world but find solace somewhere that he has inspired us to achieve what we can be. Mamba Lives On!
